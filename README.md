<h1>Description</h1>

<p><strong>Algorithmic Advances for Single-Cell and Spatial Omics Data Analysis</strong><br>
With recent technological breakthroughs in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, as well
as spatial proteomics and other spatially resolved omics platforms, researchers now have
access to molecular data at unprecedented resolution in both cellular identity and spatial
context. These technologies have opened new frontiers in understanding tissue
organization, developmental biology, and disease pathology. However, extracting
meaningful insights from these complex, high-dimensional, and often noisy datasets
requires the development of novel computational methods and algorithmic frameworks.
To date, a wide array of algorithms has been proposed for tasks such as cell type
deconvolution, spatial domain detection, gene–gene interaction modeling, cell–cell
communications, and integrative multi-modal analysis. As spatial and single-cell data
types become increasingly diverse, scalable and robust computational approaches are
needed to bridge modalities, leverage spatial information, and reveal previously
inaccessible layers of biological regulation.</p>

<p>We invite investigators to contribute Original Research articles focused on designing,
applying, or benchmarking algorithms for analyzing single-cell and spatial omics data.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Computational methods for analyzing single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data</li>
  <li>Algorithms for spatial domain and tissue architecture identification</li>
  <li>Methods for inferring cell–cell communication and signaling networks in spatial context</li>
  <li>Methods for exploring the tumor microenvironment from spatial transcriptomics data</li>
  <li>Joint analysis of spatial transcriptomics, images and spatial proteomics data, or other omics data</li>
  <li>Machine learning and deep learning approaches for multi-omics integration at single-cell resolution</li>
  <li>New tools for trajectory inference and lineage tracing with spatial information</li>
  <li>Data-driven frameworks for 3D reconstruction and spatial modeling of tissues</li>
  <li>Denoising, imputation, deconvolution and normalization methods tailored to spatial and single-cell data</li>
  <li>Algorithmic innovations for cross-sample alignment, batch correction, and reference mapping</li>

<p>This special issue aims to highlight the state-of-the-art in algorithmic development for
spatial and single-cell omics, and to foster a community of researchers pushing the

<strong>Title:</strong> scGALA advances graph link prediction-based cell alignment for comprehensive data integration and harmonization
</p>

<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
<!-- Replace the placeholder paragraph below with the real abstract -->
<span style="color:#555;">
Accurate alignment of cells across heterogeneous single-cell datasets remains a fundamental bottleneck in data integration. Existing approaches rely heavily on geometric proximity in expression space and therefore struggle when datasets differ in modality, platform, or contain strong batch effects and non-linear biological relationships. These limitations propagate through downstream analyses, leading to suboptimal batch correction, label transfer, multi-omics integration, and spatial alignment. A unified and robust alignment framework is urgently needed.
In this talk, I will introduce scGALA, a graph-based learning framework that reconceptualizes cell alignment as a masked link-prediction problem. scGALA constructs comprehensive intra- and inter-dataset cell–cell graphs, applies a multi-scale Graph Attention Network to infer reliable correspondences, and refines them with an iterative score-based optimization strategy. This relational formulation enables scGALA to recover biologically coherent mappings that extend beyond local geometric similarity and flexibly incorporate auxiliary information, including multi-omics features and spatial coordinates.
Built on this enhanced alignment backbone, scGALA functions both as a universal integration module and as a standalone system capable of advanced applications, including mosaic tri-omics construction, cross-modality RNA generation from ATAC, and high-resolution spatial transcriptomics enhancement. scGALA provides a robust, scalable, and versatile foundation for harmonizing heterogeneous single-cell datasets, substantially strengthening both conventional and emerging multi-omics analyses.
